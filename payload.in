User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a Transport Layer protocol. UDP is a part of Internet Protocol suite, referred as UDP/IP suite. Unlike TCP, it is unreliable and connectionless protocol. So, there is no need to establish connection prior to data transfer. 

Though Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the dominant transport layer protocol used with most of Internet services; provides assured delivery, reliability and much more but all these services cost us with additional overhead and latency. Here, UDP comes into picture. For the realtime services like computer gaming, voice or video communication, live conferences; we need UDP. Since high performance is needed, UDP permits packets to be dropped instead of processing delayed packets. There is no error checking in UDP, so it also save bandwidth.
